This is an automatic differentiation library written in D supporting one-dimensional, real-valued derivatives of arbitrary 
order. It is not a high performance library. It could become one; I'm not against that by any means! It's just that I 
originally built this library after learning about automatic differentiation. The elegance of the concept struct me.  I 
had to implement it.  

Features
--------

* supports all of D's arithmetic operators
* supports the same set of functions as std.math
* allows any type that is semantically a mathematical field and acts like a D floating point type as its underlying value type.
* supports arbitrary order differentiation, must be fixed a compile time
