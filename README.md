This is an automatic differentiation library written in D supporting one-dimensional, real-valued derivatives of arbitrary order. It is not a high performance library. It could become one; I'm not against that by any means! It's just that I originally built this library after learning about automatic differentiation. The elegance of the concept struct me. I had to implement it.

## Features

* supports all of D's arithmetic operators
* supports the same set of functions as `core.math`
* supports the same set of functions as `std.math`
* supports the same set of functions as `std.mathspecial`
* supports arbitrary order differentiation, must be fixed at compile time
