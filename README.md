automatic differentiation library written in D and supporting one-dimensional, real-valued derivatives of arbitrary order

Purpose
-------

This is not a high performance library. It could become one; I'm not against that by any means! It's just that I 
originally built this library after learning about automatic differentiation.  The elegance of the concept struct me.  I had to implement it.  

This library attempts to provide a near drop-in replacement for reals in numerics.

To be continued...
